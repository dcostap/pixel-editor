/** Created by Darius on 08-Sep-18.
 *
 * A Table which needs to be added as Actor to the stage itself. (addActor()).
 * Then add _only_ one child to this Table (.add())
 *
 * Now you can move this table around with .setPosition() (like you normally would with any Actor added with addActor()).
 * But this Table will also automatically resize the child, unlike what would normally happen with a Table added with addActor().
 * Add all the content to the child.
 *
 * Basically you can have a floating Table / Window / whatever (with arbitrary position) which also has its size taken care
 * of by this parent Table. So the contents of that child define the size and any change will make the parent Table automatically resize.
 *
 * Take into account that in UI design draggable windows usually never change size,
 * so the standard behavior of a Table / Window added with addActor works fine for those cases.
 * In a normal Window, just add the contents and call pack() once when finished
 *
 * Solves this problem:
 *
 * I wanna have the resizing that comes when you add children to a Table, but without the position constraints
 * (because when you add children to a Table, that Table will take care of the sizing)
 *
 * If I understood how exactly Table takes care of that, I could replicate that in the Window that has no table parent.
 * It has something to do with invalidate, validate, pack etc
 * The other option is calling pack each frame... it works
